<p>
  Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can damage any part of the body (<a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/entry/skin">skin</a>, <a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/entry/joints-muscle-pain-in-lupus">joints</a>, and/or <a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/topics/lupus-in-the-body">organs</a>). "Chronic" means that the <a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/entry/reducing-time-to-diagnosis">signs</a> and <a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/entry/common-symptoms">symptoms</a> tend to last longer than six weeks and often for many years.
</p>

<p>
  In lupus, something goes wrong with the immune system, which is the part of the body that fights off viruses, bacteria, and germs ("foreign invaders," like the flu). Normally our immune systems produce proteins called "antibodies" which protect the body from these invaders.
</p>

<p>
  "Autoimmunity" means your immune system cannot tell the difference between these foreign invaders and your bodyâ€™s healthy tissues ("auto" means "self"). As a result, it creates autoantibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissue.
</p>

<p>
  These autoantibodies cause inflammation, pain, and damage in various parts of the body.
