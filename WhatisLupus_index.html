      Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can damage any part of the body (<a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/entry/skin">skin</a>, <a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/entry/joints-muscle-pain-in-lupus">joints</a>, and/or <a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/topics/lupus-in-the-body">organs</a>). "Chronic" means that the <a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/entry/reducing-time-to-diagnosis">signs</a> and <a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org/entry/common-symptoms">symptoms</a> tend to last longer than six weeks and often for many years.
      <br>
      In lupus, something goes wrong with the immune system, which is the part of the body that fights off viruses, bacteria, and germs ("foreign invaders," like the flu).
      <br>
      Normally our immune systems produce proteins called "antibodies" which protect the body from these invaders.
      <br>
      "Autoimmunity" means your immune system cannot tell the difference between these foreign invaders and your body’s healthy tissues ("auto" means "self"). As a result, it creates autoantibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissue.
      <br>
      These autoantibodies cause inflammation, pain, and damage in various parts of the body.

          Lupus is not like or related to cancer. Cancer is a condition of malignant, abnormal tissues that grow rapidly and spread into surrounding tissues.

        <li>
          Lupus is not like or related to HIV (Human Immune Deficiency Virus) or AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). In HIV or AIDS the immune system is underactive; in lupus, the immune system is overactive.
