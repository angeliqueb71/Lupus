    <!---------Emmas Story---------------->
      <h1><strong>Emma's story</strong></h1>
    <div class="p1">
      At age 21 I collapsed and was rushed into hospital with severe renal failure. I was in intensive care for a couple of days and then back onto haemodialysis, a kidney biopsy was taken. My kidney started working for themselves again, which lasted for about a year until I had to go back to start peritoneal dialysis. I'm now awaiting a kidney/pancreas transplant.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have been diabetic since the age of two so whenever I go to hospital they always assume diabetes is the problem. This was the case when my kidneys first failed, but I'd been having regular renal checks at the diabetic clinic with no problems showing up. The fact my kidneys failed so quickly is now put down to the lupus flare up, triggered by a drug I'd been taking as part of my treatment for diabetes.
      <br>
      <br>
      If I look back at my teenage symptoms; put down as 'problem teen skin' and 'growing pains' from age 16 it looks as though that was lupus.
      <br>
      <br>
      I now take a huge variety of drugs to control the renal problems and my diabetes. I tend to live for the moment as I don't know how I'll be feeling from day to day, so on the occasions I do feel well I make the most of it. I'm hoping the situation will improve after the transplant. <br>
      <br>
      I trained as an animator then set myself up as a freelance artists, this way I can choose my own hours and work at something I love. At the moment though my body has become worn out with my kidneys not working so I don't earn enough to fully support myself. I am, however, using this time to put together ideas on a children's book I want to write.
      <br>
      <br>
      My friends and family are all very supportive, my mum tends to be a bit of a 'worry wort', especially as she's a biomedical scientist. Friends know I get tired easily but also that I'm a feisty madam that doesn't give in easily!! They tend to worry more than I do when we're out on the town.
      <br>
      <br>
      My life is different to others of my age in that I'm very ambitious, as are my friends. I'm always supportive of their success in their careers I do have to take a step back and not put too much pressure on myself to work for those things as quickly as they might.
      <br>
      <br>
      You have to almost develop an inner confidence when hit with something like lupus. I get terrible arthritis when it flares and am not even that agile at other times so I have to ask for help from others. When it affects my skin and hair I have to not be afraid to go out and have fun. When I get yet another symptom I have to deal with the problem and not hide from it.
      <br>
      <br>
      We are still up against medical staff that have little or no knowledge of lupus and yet we have to trust them with our health and wellbeing. I still have doctors who treat me as though it's all in my head.
      <br>
      <br>
      There's no way of gaining full control of your lupus but you can put the controls into practise to get the best out of your condition. I'm currently filling my life with as much fun and positivity as possible before the transplant, to be in the best frame of mind if my lupus does decide to flair.

      <h1><strong>Carlotta's story</strong></h1>
    <div class="p2">
      I'm a 46 years old black female married with two children age 26 and 18. I was first diagnosed with Lupus (SLE - systemic lupus erythematosus) in 1995.
      <br>
      <br>
    It all started with a throat infection and joint pains that lasted for several weeks.
      <br>
      <br>
      My doctor referred me to the hospital
      to see a rheumatologist and I mentioned that my mum had lupus.
      <br>
      <br>
      A test was carried out and it was confirmed within two weeks that I had SLE.
      <br>
    I suffered with mild symptoms such as hair loss, fever achy joints and fatigue for years but was blessed as I only had to take mild pain medication and was able to maintain an active lifestyle and a full time job.
      <br>
      <br>
      In September 2000 I was admitted to hospital with a haemorrhage I had to have five and a half pints of blood transfused and a week later a major operation. I know that I had put my family through a lot recently but this one was a shock to them, not knowing if I was going to pull through - but the almighty had other plans for me.
      <br>
      <br>
    I made it through and I am strong and ready to fight back, I am grateful to have god and my family by my side.
      <br>

    <h1><strong>Aloma's story</strong></h1>
  <div class="p2">
  Friday, 30th November, 2007 and my life changed forever. I had not been feeling well for quite a while but kept putting it down to hormone problems and my hysterectomy that I had had a year earlier. I had invited people over for the evening and had everything prepared so decided I would get a quick workout in and went off to the gym like I normally did. Because I was short of time thought I would just do a warm up on the treadmill and two rounds of circuit.

    <br>
    <br>
I ran on the treadmill only for 20 minutes (I normally did 45 minutes) - finished one round of circuit - stopped for a recovery, picked up my water bottle and as I
started to drink an instant intense pain wracked my body - first my head - thought - that's a bit weird...
    <br>
    <br>
   then another wrack of pain down my back - sat down - more pain - more intense and becoming excruciating -
   I suddenly started to feel strange and thought to myself I needed to get down to my car..
    <br>
    <br>
  I slowly and painfully made my way out to my car - just - now in A LOT of pain and starting to feel somewhat panicky and realising that something was not right at all - I managed to open the car door and collapse into the seat - the pain was becoming so intense and now I was crying - every second was worse and I started to think that something was definitely wrong..
    <br>
  I tried to phone my husband but he was out or range - tried my daughter and got her voice mail - tried my nearest friend who was
    <br>
    by my side within five minutes - she phoned my GP who said it sounded like I was having a brain haemorrhage
    but could not be sure and was to get me into her surgery straight away - (my daughter had arrived also by this stage) and Margie (my very good close friend) and my youngest daughter,
     Dana drove me up to my GPs surgery by which time I was starting to rant
    <br>
and rave and crying desperately and losing it...Unknown to me and what was going on around me at this stage she had phoned other
    <br>
    <br>
    specialists for a second opinion and they had told my family (apparently my husband had arrived and my brother by this stage) that I was indeed having a brain haemorrhage and an ambulance was called and I was taken straight into ICU and was in a very critical condition.
    <br>
    <br>
    I survived the initial attck in the ICU and now Im aware of the uphill battle it can be in fighting Lupus.
